# TRS
Modules use Rack's polyphonic cables to model analog eurorack modules that pass signals in (stereo) pairs over TRS cables.

Support for up to 8 polyphonic stereo pairs on one cable.

Use TSTRSTS module to "load" mono signals onto the TRS cabling system and "unload" stereo pairs to two mono outputs.
